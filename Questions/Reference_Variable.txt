we cannot return refernce variable in a functionas it will return an error because it is a bad practice .
it could have been modified by someone elese or it could be possible we might not be able top access the local variable in the function



When a program starts there are two types of memory

one is stack and heap

stack is smaller memory and heap is bigger memory

never put an array size to cin as it is a very bad practice because the compiler get to know the memory size during runtime not during compile time

the constant memory that we use is used by stack
the variable memory is created by the heap

In static memory is release automatically while in dynamic we have to do it manually

int *ptr = new int;

delete ptr

int *arr = new int[50];

delete []arr;

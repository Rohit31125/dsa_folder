Stable sorting algorithms preserve the relative order of equal 
elements, while unstable sorting algorithms don't. 
In other words, stable sorting maintains the position 
of two equals elements relative to one another.

In computer science, an in-place algorithm is an algorithm that operates
directly on the input data structure without requiring extra space 
proportional to the input size. In other words, it modifies the input 
in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure.



gcd can be calculated by 
gcd(a,b) = gcd(a-b,b)
        = gcd(a%b ,b)
